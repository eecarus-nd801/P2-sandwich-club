# Sandwich Club Project

## Project Information

This project is being built as a submission for a Udacity Android Developer Nanodegree in conjunction with a Grow with Google Scholarship.

The original starter code was provided by Udacity in [Github](https://github.com/udacity/sandwich-club-starter-code).

## Project Overview (copied from Udacity Github site)

In this project, you will complete the **Sandwich Club** app to
show the details of each sandwich once it is selected.

## Why this Project

Building a layout and populating its fields from data received as JSON
is a common task for Android Developers. Although JSON parsing is usually
done using libraries, writing the JSON parsing for  this project will
help you to better understand how it is processed.

## What Will I Learn?

Through this project, you will:

- Learn how to submit projects for review
- Practice JSON parsing to a model object
- Design an activity layout
- Populate all fields in the layout accordingly
